                    "text": "<hr><p>The coronavirus pandemic has affected our lives, our economy, and nearly every corner of the globe. Almost 4 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide â€” 53 for every 100 people. But the worldwide numbers of infections continue to rise, driven by the Delta variant with highly vaccinated regions like Western Europe and the United States, where cases are relatively low but climbing fast.</p><p>As cases continue to surge, you can take some steps to keep yourself and your family safe. Here are some tips from our trusted science team.</p><ul><li><strong>Understand the coronavirus and symptoms: </strong>The first step is to understand the coronavirus and the symptoms of coronavirus infection. Common symptoms of a coronavirus infection include shortness of breath, a cough that gets more severe over time, fever, chills, and fatigue. Less common symptoms include <em>repeated shaking with chills, sore throat, headache, muscle aches and pains, loss of taste or smell, a stuffy or runny nose, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting, discoloration of fingers or toes, pink eye, and rash.</em></li><li><strong>Avoid or limit contact with infected or people showing symptoms:</strong> The best way to prevent the transmission of the virus is to avoid or limit contact with people who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 or any respiratory infection. The next best thing you can do is practice good hygiene and physical distancing to help prevent bacteria and viruses from being transmitted.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Wear a mask: </strong></strong></strong>The CDC (Centers for Disease Control) recommends that you wear a mask that covers your mouth and nose. When worn correctly, and by a large percentage of the public, these masks can help to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID19 as masks block the respiratory droplets of people who may be asymptomatic or people who have the virus but have gone undiagnosed.</li><li><strong><strong>Seek care if you experience any of these symptoms: </strong>I</strong>f you or the person with COVID-19 experiences emergency warning signs, medical attention is needed immediately. Warning signs include:<strong> </strong><em>trouble breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, bluish lips or face, inability to stay awake or Pale, grey or colored skin, lips, or nail beds â€” depending on skin tone.</em></li><li><strong>Protect others if youâ€™re ill: </strong>If you're ill with COVID-19, you can help prevent the spread of infection with the COVID-19 virus by staying home from work, school, and public areas unless it's to get medical care, avoiding using public transportation, ride-sharing services or taxis, stay isolated in one room, away from your family and other people, as much as possible, avoid shared space in your home as much as possible and clean often-touched surfaces in your separate room and bathroom, such as doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters, every day and frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li></ul><hr><p>Stay tuned for more curated articles just for you! ðŸ˜ƒ</p><p>Sources: </p><p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/advice\">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/advice</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">What to Expect after Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you from getting COVID-19.

The need for this is to mitigate the risk of you seeking insurance after falling ill.</p><p><strong>Does every cover have limits?</strong></p><p>Yes. Every cover will have limits. This is the maximum amount you can spend based on your current policy. This will vary from inpatient, outpatient and specialist covers under your policy.
